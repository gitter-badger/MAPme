## Problem Statement ##
Capturing records through a web browser proved to be inefficient and not user-friendly.  Much of the information such as GPS coordinates had to be entered manually.  The browser lacked mobile phone support and was therefore suitable only for a desktop environment.  

## Target Market
The mobile application is aimed at an elderly user group; mostly retirees.  Therefore, design must be user-friendly and usage must be intuitive and simplistic.

## User Requirements ##
### Primary
- Registration screen requires ADU number, email and password
- Ability to interface with the phone camera
- Implement photo module to ensure picture quality (focus, precision, distance calibration)
- GPS Coordinates:
  - Interface with phone GPS location service
  - Entered manually
  - Google Maps widget
- Ability to upload photos now or later (Wi-Fi)
- Ability to upload sound files (animal noises)
- Locality description (text-box)
- Date obtained from phone settings
- Species specification (optional input)
- Other observations (optional input)
- Choose a project to submit record to (OrchidMAP, FrogMAP, MammalMAP etc.)

### Secondary
- Voice recorded notes
- Option to specify whether flower and/or fruit is visible in photograph

## Challenges
- Cross-platform compatibility (Android, Apple, Blackberry)
